        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Thank you for using <strong>Cheerify</strong>. Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information while you use the Extension. By installing and using the Extension, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or payment details.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect anonymized and aggregated data to improve the functionality and user experience of the Extension. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
        
        <h3>1.3 Data from Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>If the Extension interacts with third-party services (e.g., Google Sheets, APIs, or other applications), it accesses only the necessary data to perform its functions. This data is not stored or shared by us.</p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The Extension uses collected information solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide core functionality.</li>
            <li>Improve performance and user experience.</li>
            <li>Ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your information with third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>The Extension does not store your information on our servers. All data is processed locally within your browser or stored securely on third-party services you authorize (e.g., Gmail). We implement robust security measures to protect data during transfer and use.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The Extension may request permissions to access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gmail permissions are used only for the stated purposes and do not allow us to access unrelated information.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Extension may use third-party services, such as APIs or Google Sheets, to perform its functions. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these services. Please review their privacy policies for more information.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Our service does not retain any Google user data. We do not store, log, or save any information received from Google, as our system operates in real time without a backend database. 
            Once a session ends, all data is discarded, and no records are maintained.

Because we do not retain data, there is no need for a deletion request processâ€”Google user data is never stored beyond the active session.</p>
        
        <p>Your privacy is our priority. Thank you for trusting <strong>Cheerify</strong>.</p>
